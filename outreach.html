                <h4 class="store-text-description">
                    Outreach is a program that allows us as a team to give presentations and showcase what we do to different organizations such as schools, clubs, and community events. 
                    We love talking to differnt groups about our machines, Rube Goldburg and even STEM!
                    Outreach allows some of our membersto travel to your even or video call in, whichever method is perferred, 
                    and show off what we do as a group. In the past we have even brought our machine with us!

                <h4 class="store-text-description">
                    Setting up meeting is very easy! Just contact us via email or through one of the other contacts listed below!
                    We would be happy to set up a date and time for your meeting. 
                    As a team, we are always excited to volunteer our time and travel with or without the machine whenever possible. 
                    If in person will not work or you are located too far from our headquaters in West Lafayette, no problem!
                    We are more than willing to work with you to set up a virtual meeting whenever necessary. 

                    Once you book a time and date, availible memebers will attend your event and show case what we do as a club.
                    Machine visits, however, due to our building and competition period are limited to August in the Fall and April and May in the spring.

                <h4 class="store-text-description">
                    While our team is always happy to attend varying events, we reserve the right to ask for a video call or refuse an event if needed. 
                    We are all full-time students working hard for our degrees and work with limited funding.
                    As as result we will not travel with the machine for longer than a few hours drive from Purdue, except under special circumstances.
                    Such circumstances will be given at the team's disgression. We also request that the inviting party help pay for travel costs. 
                    This charge will only include gas and rent for the truck if the machine is requested.
