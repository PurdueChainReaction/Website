So you want to change my website

# How to get started
Firstly if you haven't already, make a github account. Then using the PurdueChainReaction login, add your github account to the repository. ![addingCollaborator](https://github.com/PurdueChainReaction/Website/assets/136839609/6f368dd6-3aed-4887-aaf3-ab34b57177c4) I would recommend you download [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and [Visual Code Studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). Git will allow you to download, edit and reupload to this repository and visual code studio is a good place to edit the code.

# Setting up Visual Code
## Extensions
After Git and Visual Code are downloaded, there are some extensions we need to get first so its easy to edit the website. To download extensions in visual code, just click on the icon of 4 boxes on the left hand side. I recommend downloading the git extension and the live server extension. The git extension makes pull requests(downloading the changed files) and push requests(uploading the files) easy to do. It also makes seeing what was changed between push requests.
