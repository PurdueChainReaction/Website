                <h2 class="title">Why?</h2>
                <h4 class="store-text-description">&emsp;&emsp;Our team has a rich history dating back to 1998, where a group of multi-disciplinary students from the 
                    Purdue Society of Professional Engineers (PSPE) first created this organization and have since created a legacy and high standard of 
                    designing, constructing, and competing with machines in the annual national competition, now known as *INSERT NEW COMPETITION NAME HERE*. 
                    For over 25 years this team has been able to offer fantastic opportunities for students to bond over their love for all things creative and 
                    out of the box while at the same time learning more about tool-working and how to implement many concepts in mechanics, physics, chemistry 
                    and more.<br><br>

                    &emsp;&emsp;Over the years we have grown and established ourselves as a top competitor in the national competition and beyond, placing 1st in the last 2 
                    competitions post-pandemic in 2022 and 2023, and finishing top-2 for each of the last 8 competitions dating back to 2014. On top of our success 
                    at competition, our organization has some very prestigious accomplishments including breaking the Guinness Book of World Records record for “Largest 
                    Rube Goldberg machine in competition” back in 2012 with a 300 step machine, as well as appearing on ABC’s Jimmy Kimmel Live in 2005, 2006 and 2015. 
                    On top of that, one of our machine’s was featured in an episode of Modern Marvels on The History Channel.<br><br>

                    &emsp;&emsp;The national competition has bounced around, recently moving back to Purdue in 2019, and just this year has been taken over by co-host of the show 
                    “Contraption Masters”, current “World’s Leading Authority” in everything Rube Goldberg, and former alumni of this organization, Zach Umperovitch. 
                    This new look competition is sponsored by Purdue’s College of Engineering and is once again in partnership with the Rube Goldberg Institute! We are 
                    so excited to see how this next iteration of the annual national competition will be like and how it can continue to expand and grow the world of 
                    Rube Goldberg machines! Our continued goal is to build another incredible, complex and exciting machine to compete in the competition with as well 
                    as expand our outreach more into the educational community to share our passion for what we do.</h4>

                <h2 class="title">How?</h2>
                <h4 class="store-text-description">&emsp;&emsp;We need every bit of help we can get to continue to operate at a high level and build these complex 
                    machines on a yearly basis.<br><br>

                    &emsp;&emsp;Every year our organization spends around $1,500, not a small amount for a self-funded organization full of college students. Nearly all of our 
                    funding comes from private donors, from parents and relatives to friends who admire what we do, so every contribution we get directly impacts our
                     ability to continue to build incredible machines and give back to the community around us. A donation of supplies is just as beneficial to our 
                     team as a monetary donation; We go through a significant amount of lumber every year and use an assortment of power tools, electrical components, 
                     scrap metal, motors, and other random items on machines every year, and who knows, if your generosity leads you to donate items to the team, 
                     you may be able to spot your item on our next machine! That being said, we do have yearly costs outside of just tools and supplies, so please 
                     consider making a financial donation as this will help us continue our work for years to come.<br><br>

                     &emsp;&emsp;Sponsors of the team will be recognized in various ways, from being listed to here on our website to a potential workshop tour and beyond 
                    depending on donation amount. The categories of recognition are shown below:</h4>
