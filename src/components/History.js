                        <h4 className="store-text-description">
                            Our team has a rich history dating back to 1998, where a group of
                            multi-disciplinary students from the Purdue Society of Professional
                            Engineers (PSPE) first created this organization and have since
                            created a legacy and high standard of designing, constructing, and
                            competing with machines in the annual national competition, now known
                            as the 2024 Rube Goldberg Machine Contest. For over 25 years this team
                            has been able to offer fantastic opportunities for students to bond
                            over their love for all things creative and out of the box while at
                            the same time learning more about tool-working and how to implement
                            many concepts in mechanics, physics, chemistry and more.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Over the years we have grown and established ourselves as a top
                            competitor in the national competition and beyond, placing 1st in the
                            last 2 competitions post-pandemic in 2022 and 2023, and finishing
                            top-2 for each of the last 8 competitions dating back to 2014. On top
                            of our success at competition, our organization has some very
                            prestigious accomplishments including breaking the Guinness Book of
                            World Records record for “Largest Rube Goldberg machine in
                            competition” back in 2012 with a 300 step machine, as well as
                            appearing on ABC’s Jimmy Kimmel Live in 2005, 2006 and 2015. On top of
                            that, one of our machine’s was featured in an episode of Modern
                            Marvels on The History Channel.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            The national competition has bounced around, recently moving back to
                            Purdue in 2019, and just this year has been taken over by co-host of
                            the show “Contraption Masters”, current “World’s Leading Authority” in
                            everything Rube Goldberg, and former alumni of this organization, Zach
                            Umperovitch. This new look competition is sponsored by Purdue’s
                            College of Engineering and is once again in partnership with the Rube
                            Goldberg Institute! We are so excited to see how this next iteration
                            of the annual national competition will be like and how it can
                            continue to expand and grow the world of Rube Goldberg machines! Our
                            continued goal is to build another incredible, complex and exciting
                            machine to compete in the competition with as well as expand our
                            outreach more into the educational community to share our passion for
                            what we do.
